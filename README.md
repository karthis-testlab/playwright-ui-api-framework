## Gerimedica Assignment for Automating UI and API Tests

As part of a technical round interview at Gerimedica, I created and wrote a test framework and test scripts using the Playwright tool for both UI and API test cases.

### UI Testcases

1. TC01- Scenario A - Verify user can enter new data into the table
2. TC01- Scenario B - Verify user can edit the row in a table
3. TC02 - Verify broken image
4. TC03 - Verify user can submit the form.
5. TC04 - Verify the progress bar
6. TC05 - Verify the tooltip
7. TC06 - Verify user can drag and drop
